# What is it?

Labrepl is an environment for exploring the Clojure language. It
includes:

* a web application that presents a set of lab exercises with
  step-by-step instructions
* an interactive repl for working with the lab exercises
* solutions with passing tests 
* up-to-date versions of Clojure, contrib, incanter, compojure and a bunch of other libraries to explore

See instructions below for getting started with NetBeans/Enclojure, Eclipse/Counterclockwise, Maven, Mac/Linux command line, Windows command line, IDEA/La Clojure, and Emacs.

## Getting Started (NetBeans with Enclojure)

* Install the [Netbeans 6.9.1 Java SE bundle](http://netbeans.org/downloads/)
* Download the [nbgit](http://code.google.com/p/nbgit/downloads/detail?name=nbgit-0.4-netbeans-6.9.nbm&can=2&q=) plugin, storing the .nbm file.
* In Netbeans install the nbgit plugin: Tools->Plugins, Downloaded.  Select "AddPlugins" then "Install" pointing it to the .nbm file from the previous step.
* Follow the [Enclosure install](http://www.enclojure.org/) directions starting at "One time setup for Enclojure Plugin and Updates".
* In a terminal or 3rd party tool, clone the labrepl project.
* In Netbeans, File->Open Project and point it to the cloned labrepl project from the previous step.
* Right-click the labrepl project and select *Start Project Repl*
* In the REPL console, type:
  * `(require 'labrepl)`
  * `(labrepl/-main)`
* Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Enjoy the labs!

## Getting Started (Eclipse with Counterclockwise)

This is a one-time setup that does not require the git command line, Maven, or leiningen.

* Install [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/):
  * Download a recent version of "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
  * Unzip it in a directory of your choosing. 
  * The executable is in the unzipped directory: eclipse (Linux), Eclipse (Mac), or eclipse.exe (Windows)
* Launch Eclipse
  * The first time it is run, Eclipse will ask you for the location where
    Eclipse will put its metadata and will create new projects by default.
* Install the Eclipse Git (EGit) plugin:
  * Go to the Help > Install New Software menu
  * For the "Work with:" site, use: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates

  * Select "Clojure Programming"
  * Verify the "Contact all update sites during ..." checkbox is checked
  * Click "Next" and accept the license when prompted
  * Click "Finish" to start the installation process
  * When Counterclockwise has been installed, restart Eclipse
* Clone the labrepl project from GitHub:
  * Go to File > Import ... > Git > Git Repository
  * Hit Next
  * For the "URI:", use: git://github.com/relevance/labrepl.git
  * Hit Next twice
  * Uncheck "Import Existing Projects" if prompted
  * Hit "Select All" and hit "Finish"
* Import the labrepl Maven project into Eclipse:
  * Go to File > Import ... > Maven > Existing Maven Projects
  * Hit Next
  * Choose the root directory where you cloned the labrepl project in the previous step
  * Verify that the pom.xml file is selected 
  * Hit Finish
* Enable Clojure support
  * Right-click the labrepl project in Package Explorer and choose "Enable/disable
    clojure language support"

To run the labrepl:

* Right click on the project in the Package Explorer and select Run As > Clojure REPL
* In the REPL console, type:
  * `(require 'labrepl)`
  * `(labrepl/-main)`
* Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Enjoy the labs!

## Getting Started (IntelliJ IDEA with La Clojure)

This is a one-time setup that does not require the git command line, Maven, or leiningen.

* Install [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). (The free Community Edition
  works fine.)
* Install the La Clojure plugin:
  * Go to File > Preferences
  * Open the Plugins preference and select the Available tab
  * Select La Clojure, right-click it, and choose "Download and Install"
* Restart IDEA.
* Clone the labrepl project from GitHub:
  * Go to Version Control > Checkout From Version Control > Git. 
  * Fill in the dialog with:
      * Git Repository URL: git://github.com/relevance/labrepl.git
      * Origin Name: (leave blank)
      * Parent Directory: (choose an arbitrary directory)
      * Directory name: labrepl
  * Hit the "Clone" button
  * Choose "Yes" when prompted to create an IDEA project, and then select:
      * Import Project from external model
      * Choose Maven if given choice of models
      * Accept all the defaults.  If this is your first time running IntelliJ you will need to choose a JDK. When prompted locate the JDK you wish to use by clicking the plus icon and clicking through the dialog.
  * Wait for Maven to download all the dependent libraries.

To run the labrepl:

* Choose Tools > Clojure REPL > Add New Clojure REPL
* In the REPL Console
  * `(require 'labrepl)`
  * `(labrepl/-main)`
* Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* Enjoy the labs!

## Getting Started (Maven)

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed.
* Clone the labrepl project and change directory into it.
* Run `mvn clojure:repl` to launch Clojure REPL (Maven will download all necessary
  dependencies).
* Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for the labs.
* Press Ctrl+D to exit the repl when you are done.

## Getting Started (Mac/Linux command line) 

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have [leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed.
* Clone the labrepl project and change directory into it.
* Run `lein deps` to install all the dependent libraries.
* Run `script/repl` to launch the labrepl.
* Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for the labs.
* Press Ctrl+D to exit the repl when you are done.

## Getting Started (Windows command line)

This is minimally tested. You are probably better off using Maven or one of the IDEs above. Let me know if you have problems.

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have [leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed. Do not use `lein self-install` as Windows installation is a manual process. You will need to:
* Download the leinigen.jar and set `LEIN_JAR` to point to it.
* Download [Clojure 1.3-alpha1](http://github.com/clojure/clojure/downloads)
* Set `CLOJURE_JAR` to point to the clojure.jar file.
* Set your path to include `{your-lein-install}\bin`
* Run `lein.bat deps` to install all the dependent libraries.
* Run `script\repl` to launch the labrepl.
* Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for the labs.
* Press Ctrl+D to exit the repl when you are done.

## Getting Started (Emacs, Mac/Linux command line)

If you don't know Emacs, you may want to pick one of the choices above. The learning curve here is steep.

* Make sure you have Java installed.
* Make sure you have [leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed.
* Clone the labrepl project and change directory into it.
* Run `lein deps` to install all the dependent libraries.
* If they exist, move your `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` out of the way.
* Create the `.emacs.d` directory and download the Emacs Starter Kit:
  * `mkdir ~/.emacs.d`
  * `cd ~/.emacs.d`
  * `git clone http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.git`
* Launch Emacs with the starter kit `emacs -l ~/.emacs.d/emacs-starter-kit/init.el`
* Within Emacs run ELPA `M-x package-list-packages`, go to the following packages and press `i` to select:
  * clojure-mode
  * slime
  * swank-clojure 
* Once the three packages are selected press `x` to install them.  Close Emacs when the installation completes.
* From a terminal in the labrepl directory run the swank process: `script/swank`
* Run Emacs again `emacs -l ~/.emacs.d/emacs-starter-kit/init.el`
* Connect to the running clojure image `M-x slime-connect` accepting the defaults.


## Running the Tests

* Maven: `mvn clojure:test`
* Shell: `script/test`
